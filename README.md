# 🏨 Hotel Booking Data Analysis Project

## 📋 Project Overview
This project analyzes a comprehensive hotel booking dataset to uncover guest preferences and booking behaviors. The primary goal was to identify the root causes of cancellations and provide data-driven recommendations to improve hotel occupancy and revenue.



## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
The interactive Excel Dashboard provides a visual summary of the following KPIs:
* **Total Bookings & Cancellations:** Real-time tracking of booking status.
* **Average Daily Rate (ADR):** Monitoring revenue performance across different hotel types.
* **Guest Segmentation:** Breakdown of Single, Couple, and Family travelers.
* **Monthly Trends:** Visualizing peak arrival months to optimize staffing and pricing.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used
* **Data Cleaning:** Used **Excel Power Query** to remove duplicates, handle null values in the `country` column, and format dates.
* **Analysis:** Created **Pivot Tables** to segment data by room type, guest category, and cancellation status.
* **Visualization:** Designed an interactive dashboard using **Slicers, Timelines, and Dynamic Charts** (Donut, Clustered Bar, and Line charts).

---

## 💡 Key Business Insights
* **Cancellation Drivers:** Guests who were assigned a room type different from their "Desired Room" showed a significantly higher cancellation rate.
* **Lead Time Impact:** Analysis suggests that bookings made more than **150 days in advance** are more prone to cancellations.
* **Revenue Peak:** **City Hotels** see a major spike in revenue during the spring, while **Resort Hotels** dominate the summer months.
